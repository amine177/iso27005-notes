\section{Elementary definitions:}
\noindent \textbf{Risk:} a risk is the effect of uncertainty on objectives, therfore
it is any event that doesn't align with the objectives and which can affect their realisation\\
\textbf{Risk identification:} describing a risk upon finding it in order to recognise it\\
\textbf{Risk level:} the magnitude which is an epxression of combining the consequences' effects
and their liklehood (probability is a narrow[mathematical] expression of a liklehood)\\
\textbf{Risk criteria:} a reference to which we compare a risk significance against\\
\textbf{Risk analysis:} understanding the nature of a risk in order to indentify its risk level\\
\textbf{Risk evaluation:} putting the results of risk analysis against a risk criteria in order
to determine if the magnitude of a risk can be tolerable or not\\
\textbf{Control:} a mesure that modifies a risk (level, magnitude, cause, consequences)
\textbf{Risk control:} well planned activities that affect risk within an organization\\
\textbf{Risk assessment:} the  whole process going from risk identification to risk analsysis reaching
risk evaluation\\
\textbf{Risk management:} the activities that puts controls and objectives within an organization with
relation to risk\\
\textbf{Risk treatment:} trying to modify a risk by:
\begin{itemize}
\item avoiding the risk by stopping the activity that gives rise to it
\item continuing the activity that entails a certain risk
\item removing the risk source
\item changing the likelihood (decreasing it obviously)
\item sharing the risk with other organizations
\item retaining the risk and informing all involved parties with that choice
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Stakeholder:} a subject [person, organization] that is affected by, affects, and perceive themselves
to be affected by the activity or decisions of an organization\\
\textbf{Internal context:} the internal environement of an organization in which it seeks
to achieve objectives. It includes but not limited to:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Organizational structure, governance, roles and accountability
\item Policies, objectives and the strategies that seek to achieve said objectives
\item Relations with the internal stakeholders and their values
\item The organization's capabilities (captial, technical knowledge, workforce and technologies)
\item The organization's culture
\item Standards, guidelines and models within the organization
\item Contracts (form, clauses)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{External context:} the external environement from an organization in which it seeks
to achieve objectives. It includes but not limited to: \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Economic environment
\item Regulatory entities and policies
\item Natural environment
\item Competitive environment
\item relaitionships with external stakeholders (suppliers, governement ..)
\end{itemize}
